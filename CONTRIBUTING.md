# Contributing

Run the tests with `composer test`. Each pull request carries one label that sets the version bump: `major`, `minor`, `patch` or `skip-release`. Every merge to `master` publishes a release.

## Credit for ported work

- Copy a file from another project: add a section to [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). It holds the project URL, the licence, the pinned commit, the file list and the upstream notice copied unchanged. Add an Apache-2.0 `NOTICE` file too when the project has one.
- Port or adapt code: add a docblock line to the class or method, even when the new code looks different. Pin the link to a commit.

  ```php
  /**
   * Adapted from mantas-done/subtitles, src/Code/Converters/StlConverter.php
   * (https://github.com/mantas-done/subtitles/blob/959d1705b1ed12cbb9ddba517f8bcb814e1919a8/src/Code/Converters/StlConverter.php), MIT.
   */
  ```

- Write "Adapted from" for a re-implementation of the same logic. Write "Copied from" for verbatim code.
- For Apache-2.0 sources, add a line "Changed: ..." that states what you changed.
- A test with data from another project names the project in its data provider key. A ported test case cites the upstream test method in a comment.
- A fixture folder lists every file in its `SOURCES.md` with its source and licence.
- A project that re-hosts another project's data gets a credit for the original source too.

## Licence rules

- Permissive sources may be adapted, always with credit.
- Copyleft, proprietary and unlicensed sources are behaviour references only. Read the behaviour or the spec, write your own code and tests, and copy nothing.
- A project not in the table: check its licence at the pinned commit before you use anything. An unknown or missing licence means ideas only.
