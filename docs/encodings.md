# Encodings and line endings

The library works in UTF-8. The `load` and `fromString` functions of `Subtitle` convert other encodings on input.

```php
use SubtitleToolbox\Format;
use SubtitleToolbox\ReadOptions;
use SubtitleToolbox\StringHelpers;
use SubtitleToolbox\Subtitle;
use SubtitleToolbox\TextEncoding;

$subtitle = Subtitle::fromString(file_get_contents('movie.srt'), Format::SubRip, new ReadOptions(encoding: TextEncoding::Windows1252));
$subtitle = Subtitle::fromStringAutoDetectFormat(file_get_contents('movie.smi'), new ReadOptions(encoding: TextEncoding::Cp949));
$subtitle = Subtitle::fromString(file_get_contents('ukrainian.srt'), Format::SubRip, new ReadOptions(encoding: 'CP1125'));
StringHelpers::isValidUtf8(file_get_contents('movie.srt'));   // false for a Windows-1252 file with letters such as é
```

## Order of the checks

`load()`, `loadAutoDetectFormat()` and the `fromString` functions take the first rule that applies:

| Step | Content | Read as |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| 1 | Starts with a BOM | The encoding of the BOM: UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. It wins over `ReadOptions::$encoding` |
| 2 | UTF-16 without a BOM | UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE, unless `ReadOptions::$encoding` names UTF-16 or UTF-32 |
| 3 | Valid UTF-8 without a zero byte | UTF-8 |
| 4 | `ReadOptions::$encoding` is set | That encoding. Detection does not run |
| 5 | A code page fits | The code page that detection picks, for example `Windows-1252` |
| 6 | Anything else | UTF-8. The parsers keep the invalid bytes |

- **Repeated BOMs**: joined files can start with 2 or more UTF-8 BOMs. Detection and the parsers drop all of them. The SubRip, WebVTT and SBV parsers and the stream readers also drop a UTF-8 BOM at the start of a line, where a joined file starts.
- **Mixed folders**: valid UTF-8 wins over `ReadOptions::$encoding`. So `subtitle-toolbox convert season1/ --encoding Windows-1256` reads both the UTF-8 and the Windows-1256 files of the folder correctly.
- **UTF-16 without a BOM**: in ASCII text, every second byte is zero. The check reads the first 1024 bytes. At least 40 % of the byte pairs must have a zero byte on one side, and at most 5 % on the other side. A UTF-8 or Windows-1252 file with a stray zero byte does not pass.
- **UTF-32 without a BOM**: such content holds zero bytes on both sides of each byte pair. It is converted only from `ReadOptions::$encoding`, for example `UTF-32LE`.
- **Code page detection**: the detector tries Windows-1250 to Windows-1258, ISO-8859-1, -2, -5, -7 and -9, KOI8-R and KOI8-U. It decodes the lines with bytes from 0x80 in each code page. Letters of the languages that use the code page score. Other letters, symbols inside words, mixed scripts and odd letter case cost. On a tie, the Windows code page wins, so ISO-8859-1 text reads as Windows-1252, which decodes it the same.
- **Limits of detection**: content with a zero byte is never detected. Content with more valid UTF-8 sequences of 2 or more bytes than invalid bytes stays UTF-8, because it is UTF-8 with a few broken bytes. CJK encodings such as Shift_JIS, GBK or CP949 are not detected and need `ReadOptions::$encoding`. Short text can get a code page that decodes it differently, for example Latvian Windows-1257 text as Windows-1252. Pass `ReadOptions::$encoding` or `--encoding` then.
- **Warnings**: in lenient mode, step 2 adds a `ParseWarning` with the action `Repaired`, such as "The content is UTF-16LE without a BOM." Step 5 adds "The content is not UTF-8. Detection picked Windows-1252. Pass --encoding if that is wrong."
- **Encoding of a subtitle**: `Subtitle::findSourceEncoding()` returns the encoding of the steps above, for example `UTF-8`, `UTF-16LE`, `Windows-1252` or the value of `ReadOptions::$encoding`. It returns null for binary formats, MKV, WebM and MP4 tracks and a subtitle that no parser read. The CLI `info` prints it as `Encoding`.
- **Binary formats**: EBU STL, PGS and VobSub skip steps 2 and 5.
- **XML declaration**: the TTML, iTT and YouTube parsers ignore `encoding="utf-16"` or `"utf-32"` in the XML declaration of UTF-8 content. This covers converted UTF-16 files and UTF-8 files that declare UTF-16.
- **Legacy text that looks like UTF-8**: a few legacy files are valid UTF-8 by chance. For example, the Windows-1252 text `Ã©` is the bytes `C3 A9`, which are `é` in UTF-8. The library reads such a file as UTF-8.
- **Invalid UTF-8**: after step 6, a parser that gets content with a byte that is not valid UTF-8 acts as below. In lenient mode, a `ParseWarning` with the action `Repaired` names the first bad byte, for example "The content is not valid UTF-8. The first bad byte is at offset 42. Pass --encoding."

| Format | Strict mode | Lenient mode |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| SubRip, WebVTT, SBV, ASS, SubViewer, CSV and the other text formats | keeps the bytes in the text | keeps the bytes and warns |
| SAMI, TTML, iTT and YouTube srv1, srv2 and srv3 | throws `ParsingException` with the message of the warning | reads each bad byte as U+FFFD and warns |

- **Output of invalid UTF-8**: the JSON, TTML, iTT and SAMI formatters throw `UnwritableContentException` for text that is not valid UTF-8.
- **JSON formats**: the JSON parsers, YouTube json3 among them, read each invalid UTF-8 byte as U+FFFD, the replacement character. For example, the bytes `42 FF 64` in a text field give `B`, U+FFFD and `d`.
- **`StringHelpers::convertToUtf8()`**: it takes steps 1, 3, 4 and 6 only. It does not detect UTF-16 without a BOM or a code page. For example, `convertToUtf8("Caf\xE9")` returns the bytes unchanged.
- **Parsers called directly**: only the `Subtitle` functions convert. Before `(new SamiParser())->parse($content, new ReadOptions())`, call `StringHelpers::convertToUtf8($content, TextEncoding::Cp949)`.
- **Source encodings**: `ReadOptions::$encoding` and `StringHelpers::convertToUtf8()` take a `TextEncoding` case or a string. The conversion uses the PHP extension iconv. A string can be any name that the iconv of the system knows, for example `CP1125`. `new ReadOptions()` throws `InvalidArgumentException` for an unknown name. A byte that is invalid in the encoding throws `ParsingException`.
- **Stored value**: `ReadOptions::$encoding` holds the iconv name as a string. `new ReadOptions(encoding: TextEncoding::Windows1252)` stores `Windows-1252`.
- **EBU STL**: the binary file holds its own character tables. Pass its bytes without a source encoding.
- **Output**: line endings and the UTF-8 BOM of the output are formatter options, see [formats.md](formats.md#write-options).

## TextEncoding cases

Each case value is the iconv name.

| Cases | Values |
|:--- |:--- |
| `Utf8`, `Utf16Le`, `Utf16Be` | `UTF-8`, `UTF-16LE`, `UTF-16BE` |
| `Windows1250` to `Windows1258` | `Windows-1250` to `Windows-1258` |
| `Iso8859_1` to `Iso8859_16`, without `Iso8859_12` | `ISO-8859-1` to `ISO-8859-16`, without `ISO-8859-12` |
| `Koi8R`, `Koi8U` | `KOI8-R`, `KOI8-U` |
| `ShiftJis`, `EucJp` | `Shift_JIS`, `EUC-JP` |
| `Gbk`, `Gb18030`, `Big5` | `GBK`, `GB18030`, `Big5` |
| `EucKr`, `Cp949` | `EUC-KR`, `CP949` |
| `Cp437`, `Cp850`, `Cp866` | `CP437`, `CP850`, `CP866` |

ISO-8859-12 has no case because no such standard exists and iconv rejects the name.
